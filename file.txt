Aim: Demonstration of reading, writing and organizing files.
a) Write a python program to accept a file name from the user and perform the following 
operations
1. Display the first N line of the file 
2. Find the frequency of occurrence of the word accepted from the user in the file
import os.path
import sys
fname = input("Enter the filename : ")
if not os.path.isfile(fname):
 print("File", fname, "doesn't exists")
 sys.exit(0)
infile = open("filename", "r")
lineList = infile.readlines()
for i in range(20):
 print(i+1,":",lineList[i])
word = input("Enter a word : ")
cnt = 0
for line in lineList:
 cnt += line.count(word)
print("The word", word, "appears", cnt, "times in the file")
b) Write a python program to create a ZIP file of a particular folder which contains several 
files inside it.
import os
import sys
import pathlib
import zipfile
dirName = input("Enter Directory name that you want to backup : ")
if not os.path.isdir(dirName):
 print("Directory", dirName, "doesn't exists")
 sys.exit(0)
curDirectory = pathlib.Path(dirName)
with zipfile.ZipFile("myZip.zip", mode="w") as archive:
 for file_path in curDirectory.rglob("*"):
 archive.write(file_path, arcname=file_path.relative_to(curDirectory))
if os.path.isfile("myZip.zip"):
 print("Archive", "myZip.zip", "created successfully")
else:
 print("Error in creating zip archive")
